                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I am Wangchuk Gyeltshen Zangpo, I am a seventeen year old college student studying as a first year in the College of Science and Technology. The course I am studying is Software Engineering.</p>
                <p>I am currently studying HTML and CSS while also studying Python. My hobbies include listening to a lot of music and playing chess. I have participated in one national tournament where I ranked 5th and I also won the chess tournament held in Gedu College this semester. Playing chess has made me more cerebral and also improved my problem solving skills.</p>
                <p>Ever since I was introduced to programming I have been interested in website and game building. Hence, this is the reason I took this course. Although I don’t find HTML, CSS and others easy I am determined to work hard and do what it takes to become a good website builder.</p>
