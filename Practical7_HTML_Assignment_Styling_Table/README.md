# Practical Report for HTML Semester Grades Table Practical

### Instructions
This project demonstrates how to create a structured table to display semester grades using HTML and CSS. The table organizes data for modules, assignments/exams, marks, and grades in a visually appealing format. CSS is used extensively to style the table, text, and overall layout.

### Guided Practical Exercises
1. **HTML Table Structure**  
   - Used `<table>` with `<tr>` (table row), `<th>` (table header), and `<td>` (table data) tags to display grade details.  
   - Included columns for Module, Assignment/Exam Name, Maximum Marks, Marks Obtained, Percentage, and Grade.

2. **CSS Styling**  
   - Styled the table, headers, and data rows using `font-family`, `color`, and `border` properties.  
   - Applied `margin-top` and `margin-left` for positioning the table and heading.  
   - Added a `background-size` property for the background container to enhance the presentation.

3. **Enhanced Readability**  
   - Used consistent fonts and colors for headers (`th`) and table data (`td`) for better distinction.  
   - Ensured the table's borders are clearly visible with the `border-collapse` property.
