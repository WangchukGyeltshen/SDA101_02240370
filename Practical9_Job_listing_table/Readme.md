# Practical Report for HTML Job Listings Table Practical

### Instructions
This project demonstrates how to create a styled job listings table using HTML and CSS. The table includes columns for job title, company, location, and application deadlines. TailwindCSS-inspired class names are used for styling, making the table visually appealing and responsive.

### Guided Practical Exercises

1. **HTML Table Structure**  
   - Used semantic HTML tags like `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>` to structure the table.  
   - Added columns for job title, company, location, and application deadlines.  

2. **CSS Styling**  
   - Applied basic styles using a `<style>` block, including borders for table cells with `border-collapse`.  
   - Incorporated hover effects on table rows for interactivity (`hover:bg-gray-50`).  
   - Used padding and font properties to make table content visually distinct and legible.

3. **Responsive Design**  
   - Enabled horizontal scrolling for smaller devices using the `overflow-x-auto` container.  
   - Used `min-w-full` for the table to ensure it adapts well to varying screen sizes.
