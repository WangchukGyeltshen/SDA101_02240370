# Practical Report for HTML and CSS Landing Page Practical

### Instructions
This project combines HTML and CSS to create a simple yet functional landing page for a tech shop. The page includes a navigation bar, product display section, and a footer with social media icons and additional links. CSS is used for layout, styling, and responsiveness.

### Guided Practical Exercises

1. **HTML Structure**  
   - Used semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.) to organize the content.  
   - Created a navigation bar with links for different sections of the site.  
   - Developed a product display grid that showcases products with images, names, and prices.  
   - Included a footer with useful links and social media icons using Font Awesome.  

2. **CSS Styling**  
   - Styled the navigation bar to align items horizontally with the `flexbox` layout.  
   - Designed a responsive product grid using `grid-template-columns` to ensure optimal display on various screen sizes.  
   - Applied consistent font styles, padding, and colors to maintain a cohesive look throughout the page.  
   - Styled the footer for a clean and minimalistic design with centered content.  

3. **Media Elements**  
   - Integrated images into the product display with uniform sizes using CSS properties.  
   - Added hover effects on navigation links to improve interactivity.
