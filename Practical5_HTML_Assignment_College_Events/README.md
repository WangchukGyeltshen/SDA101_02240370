# Practical Report for HTML College Events Practical

### Instructions
This project demonstrates how to create a structured HTML list to display college events and their details. The list includes main event categories and sub-items such as specific event names, locations, and timings. Styling is applied using CSS for better readability and interactivity.

### Guided Practical Exercises
1. **Ordered and Unordered Lists**  
   - Used `<ol>` for the main event categories and `<ul>` for sub-items such as event details.  
   - Nested multiple `<ul>` elements within each `<li>` item to represent details like location and time.

2. **CSS Styling**  
   - Styled the event headers (`h1`) and list items (`li`) using font family, size, and color properties.  
   - Implemented a hover effect using the `.Events:hover` class to highlight event categories when hovered.
