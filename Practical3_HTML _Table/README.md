# Practical Report for HTML Table Practical

## Instructions
This project demonstrates how to create a basic HTML table with styled elements using inline CSS. The table displays student information, including First Name, Last Name, Student Number, and Grade. The header row includes basic formatting, such as a blue-colored "First Name" column header.

### Guided Practical Exercises
1. Set up the HTML structure with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings.
2. Define a `<table>` element and use `<tr>` (table row) and `<td>` (table data) tags to populate the data rows.
3. Apply inline styling (`style` attribute) to the "First Name" header to change its text color to blue.
4. Use CSS in the `<style>` section to add borders to table cells (`th`, `td`)
