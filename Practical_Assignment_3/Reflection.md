# Front-End Development Assignment

## Documentation

The core idea of this assignment is **"translating visual designs into functional web pages."** Students must take a visual mockup and create a responsive, interactive web page using **HTML** and **CSS/TailwindCSS**. This involves:

- **HTML**: Structuring content with proper tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: Using Tailwind's utility classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the page adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Utility-First Styling**: Styling directly in HTML with Tailwindâ€™s predefined classes.
- **Attention to Detail**: Ensuring accuracy in layout, typography, and color schemes.
- **Interactivity**: Adding hover effects or animations with Tailwind classes like `hover:bg-color`, `transition`.
- **Maintainability**: Writing clean, efficient, and well-commented code for future updates.

### New Skills Acquired

Through this assignment, I have become more proficient in using various **Tailwind CSS classes** and utilities.

## Reflection

From this assignment, I learned how to efficiently translate designs into responsive web pages using **HTML** and **TailwindCSS**. It strengthened my skills in creating clean structures, applying utility-first styling, and ensuring cross-browser consistency, all while focusing on detail and maintainability.

### Challenges

Some challenges I faced included:
- Accurately replicating the design's layout and spacing using **TailwindCSS** utility classes.
- Ensuring the page was fully responsive across different devices.
